            Gary Disco was born in 1901 in Edina, New York. From an early age,
            he displayed a remarkable sense of discipline and a strong work
            ethic, qualities that defined his life and career. When World War II
            broke out, Gary enlisted in the military, gaining respect for his
            dedication and exceptional performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the war, Gary returned to Edina and noticed a lack of diners
            and social venues. He decided to open Gary Disco's Diner, a unique
            establishment. From 7 AM to 7 PM, it operated as a classic diner
            with staff in standard uniforms serving delicious meals. At 7 PM,
            the atmosphere transformed: the lights dimmed, and the diner became
            a disco. Staff swapped their uniforms for roller skates and
            military-esque outfits, adding a dynamic flair to the nightly
            festivities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tragically, Gary Disco passed away in 1946, but his legacy lived on.
            The diner was taken over by three Canadian owners who upheld Gary's
            traditions. They continued enforcing the double outfit rule,
            ensuring the diner remained a cherished landmark in Edina, known for
            its excellent food and vibrant nightlife.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the war, Gary was often seen doodling the logo for his dream
            diner on scraps of paper. Today, we celebrate his vision by still
            using his original logo and font.
